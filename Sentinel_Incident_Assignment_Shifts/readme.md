## Pre-requisites:

Ensure you have the following details to hand:


### 1. Sentinel Workspace details

- Workspace Name.

- Workspace Resource Group Name.

### 2. Service Principal with the Azure Sentinel Responder role
Create or use an existing Service Principal with the Azure Sentinel Responder role.

**Steps to create a new Service Principal:**

Follow the steps in this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal):

- Register an application to Azure AD and create a Service Principal.

- Create a new application secret.

- Assign a role to the application (assign the **Azure Sentinel Responder** role).


### 3. Shifts for Teams
- You must have the [Shifts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-in-shifts-5f3e30d8-1821-4904-be26-c3cd25a497d6) schedule setup in Microsoft Teams.

- The Shifts schedule must be published (**Share with team**).

### 4. Permission on Azure AD
- There is an Azure AD connector in this Logic App to get details for a user.
- To use the Azure AD connector, you need to **Sign-in** with an account with the following administrator permissions:
    - Group.ReadWrite.All
    - User.ReadWrite.All
    - Directory.ReadWrite.All


### 5. An O365 account to be used to send email notification
- Login details of the O365 account.



## Post Deployment Configuration:

- Once deployed, edit the Logic App and find the connectors (6 in total) that has been marked with <img src="https://github.com/tatecksi/SentinelPlaybooks/blob/master/Sentinel_Incident_Assignment_Shifts/media/pic1.png" width="30" height="30">. 
- Fix these connectors by adding a new connection to each connector within your Logic App and sign in to authenticate.
- For the Shifts connector, make sure you have selected the Teams channel with a Shifts schedule.

- Save the Logic App once you have completed the above steps.





## Incident Assignment Logic:

Incidents are assigned to users based on the following criteria:

- Only users who have started their shifts during the time the Logic App runs will be considered.
- Users who still have at least **1** hours left before going off shift. 
  
  You can change this value by modifying the below variable:

- Users who have had the fewer incidents assigned to them over the past 24 hours will be assigned incident first.

- If an incident is already assigned to someone, triggering this Playbook will not perform reassignment.

  Although not recommended, but you can modify the following variable to allow reassignment:

## Email Notification:

- When an incident is assigned, the incident owner will be notified via email.
- Below is the sample email notification:

- The email body has a banner with colour mapped to incident's severity (High=red, Medium=orange, Low=yellow and Informational=grey).
